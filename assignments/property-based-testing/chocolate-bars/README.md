We are packing chocolate bars. A package should store a total number of kilograms. There are small bars (1 kg each) and big bars (5 kg each).

The input of the program is the number of small bars and big bars available, and the total number of kilos to store. We should calculate the number of small bars to use, assuming we always use big bars before small bars. Output -1, if it can't be done.

Write property-based tests for this method.
