In this exercise, you will be testing the `isLeapYear` method.

> This method returns whether a year is a leap year or not. Leap years are either (i) multiples of 400, or (ii) are multiples of 4 but not multiples of 100. The implementation is quite straightforward.

Use **property-based testing** to create a suitable test suite for this method.

Tips:

- Have the [JQWik manual](https://jqwik.net/docs/current/user-guide.html) at hand.
