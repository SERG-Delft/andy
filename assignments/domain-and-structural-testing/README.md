# Domaing and Structural Testing
In this folder, you find lots of exercises for you to practice domain and structural testing.

- Take a look at the documentation of the problem. You have some information in the description of the question. Some others also have a JavaDoc near the method. Follow the specification-based testing techniques we discussed.
- Do some boundary testing. After all, bugs love boundaries.
- Once you are done, then, go for structural testing. Are there any tests you missed?

Also, try and automate your test cases.
