In this exercise, you will be testing the `substringsBetween` method.


> This method searches a String for substrings delimited by a start and end tag, returning all matching substrings in an array.


Use **specification-based testing** to create a suitable test suite for this method.  Then, augment your test suite with **structural testing**.

This method was taken from [Apache Commons Lang.](https://github.com/apache/commons-lang/blob/d2687419c6973572d1621afc1b8546f5262769c3/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/lang3/StringUtils.java#L8905)
