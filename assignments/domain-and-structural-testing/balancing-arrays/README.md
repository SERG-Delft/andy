In this exercise, you will be testing the `canBalance` method.

> Given a non-empty array of non-negative numbers, this method return true if there is a place to split the array so that the sum of the numbers on one side is equal to the sum of the numbers on the other side.

Use **specification-based testing** to create a suitable test suite for this method. Then, augment your test suite with **structural testing**.

Tips:

- This does **not** work for negative numbers, you can skip those tests.
