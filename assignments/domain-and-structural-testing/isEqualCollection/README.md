In this exercise, you will be testing the `isEqualCollection` method.

> Returns true iff the given Collections (<i>a</i> and <i>b</I>) contain exactly the same elements with exactly the same cardinalities. That is, iff the cardinality of <i>e</i> in <i>a</i> is equal to the cardinality of <i>e</i> in <i>b</i>, for each element <i>e</i> in <i>a</I>.

Use **specification-based testing** to create a suitable test suite for this method. Then, augment your test suite with **structural testing**.
