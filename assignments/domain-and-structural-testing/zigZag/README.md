In this exercise, you will be testing the `zigzag` method.

> This method receives a string `s` and a number of rows `numRows`, and writes it down in a zigzag pattern.

Example:

> Suppose a string `"PAYPALISHIRING"`, and number of rows = 4. The zigzag would look like the following:

>
```
P  I  N
A LS IG
YA HR
P  I
```

> Note the "PAYP" in the first vertical row (zig), then "A" and "L" going up (zag), then, another vertical row "ISHI" (zig), then "R" and "I" going up, and finally "NG" (zig).

Use **specification-based testing** to create a suitable test suite for this method. Then, augment your test suite with **structural testing**.
