In this exercise, you will be testing the `toCamelCase` method.

> This method converts all the delimiter-separated words in a String into camelCase. This means that each word will be made up of a titlecase character and then a series of lowercase characters.

Use **specification-based testing** to create a suitable test suite for this method. Then, augment your test suite with **structural testing**.
