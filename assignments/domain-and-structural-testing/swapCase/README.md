In this exercise, you will be testing the `swapCase` method.

> This method swaps the case of a String using a word based algorithm:
>
- Upper case character converts to Lower case
- Lower case character converts to Upper case

Use **specification-based testing** to create a suitable test suite for this method.

*This method was taken from the [Apache Commons Lang](https://github.com/apache/commons-lang/blob/d2687419c6973572d1621afc1b8546f5262769c3/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/lang3/StringUtils.java#L8963).*
