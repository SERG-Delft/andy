In this exercise, you will be testing the `countClumps` method.

> This method returns the number of clumps in a given array. A "clump" in an array is a series of two or more adjacent elements of the same value.

Use **specification-based testing** to create a suitable test suite for this method. Then, augment your test suite with **structural testing**.

*This method was taken from [Coding Bat](http://www.javaproblems.com/2013/11/java-array-3-countclumps-codingbat.html).*
