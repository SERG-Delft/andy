SoftWHERE is a new travel agency created and run by developers. 
Because they never took SQT, they need your help to test their reservation system.

Your goal is to perform domain testing and structural testing on the `editTripCapacity` method. You should make use of mocks.

Tips:

- There are many ways to instantiate a `LocalDate`. For example, you can use the static call `LocalDate.of(1998,2,5)`. In this
example, the date points to February 5th, 1998.
- Mock only classes that deserve to be mocked.
