In this exercise, you should test the `sendGradesToStudents` method from an application which can process and send course grades.

> This method sends an email to students about their grades for a course. In case the system fails when sending the emails, the method returns the list of e-mails that failed.

Use **test doubles** to create a suitable test suite for this method. But, careful, you should only mock dependencies that "deserve to be mocked".
