# Stubs, Fakes and Mocks
In this folder you will find exercises for you to practice with stubs, fakes and mocks.

- Take a look at the documentation of the problem. You have some information in the description of the question.
- Think about which parts of the code have to be tested using stubs, fakes or mocks.
- Once you have figured out which methods or classes to replace, think about if you need to stub, fake or mock them.

Try and think about conditions you want your mocks to have, e.g. how many times a method is called.
