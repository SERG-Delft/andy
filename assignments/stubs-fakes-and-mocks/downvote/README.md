In this exercise, you will be testing the `downvote` method from StackOverflow (or an imaginary, simplified version of it).

> This method lowers a user's points when their post is downvoted.

Use **test doubles** to create a suitable test suite for this method.

Tips:

- Only mock the dependencies that deserve to be mocked.
